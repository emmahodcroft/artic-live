# ARTIC-live!

Nextstrain data, pipelines, and visualizations for novel pathogen outbreak as part of ARTIC-network live workshop

Once you've run the pipeline, you can push the builds to `artic-live/auspice` so that they can be viewed via Nextstrain community builds feature. 
This github has this folder populated already so that one doesn't have to run the pipelines.

**Currently these builds still has the case labelled case128, and case numbers are nonsensical.**
